# COMP207
This is a repository about a class I took at the University of Liverpool called COMP207: Database development. 


This is the main SQL assignment in this module (the other assignments are the weekly MCQs). It consists of making a relational database about a store while supporting things such as promotions on items.

The assignment is to create a supermarket database for a CS Store supermarket. Most of the tables
are what you would expect from the videos on SQL (with a similar, but not always identical set of
attributes). The twist compared to the slides (otherwise, if you could just follow the slides without
thinking, it would be a bit too easy) is that we will also want to support promotions ala buy one, get
one free or buy 5 items, get the 3 cheapest free â€“ you buy some items of a type and get some of the
cheapest ones free.
